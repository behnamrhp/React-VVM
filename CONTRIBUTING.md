## Sending Pull Requests

Before working on updates, please check existing issues or open a new issue for discussion. If working on an existing issue, ensure it has an appropriate label:

- `change`: For updates that will change user API usage
- `feature`: For updates that add new features without changing previous APIs
- `fix`: For fixes to minor bugs that do not impact previous APIs
- `doc`: For updates to documentation

### Pull Request Process

1. Clone the project.
2. Create your branch based on the `develop` branch. Use a prefix for your branch based on the issue label. For example: `feature/add-button`.
3. Ensure your changes pass build, linting, and Storybook checks.
4. Make your pull request to the `develop` branch.
5. Check CI results on your pull request and ensure everything is fine.

After submitting your pull request, we will review it and try to provide feedback as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
